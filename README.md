# Afkanerd

## Who is
Afkanerd is an organization focused on bringing a unified platform for nerds in all domains. Being the leading innovators of any eco-system <i>(science, arts, commerce)</i>, nerds would acquire synergy being unified to work on common goals. 

## Why the name
Nerd (minus the conventional description) is a smart person in whatever domain such a one is engaged in. 
Africa was taken because it’s known as the cradle of civilization. So the thought process of Afkanerd would be to imply smart beginnings. <br>
<i>Afkanerd is an <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/elision">elision</a> of Africa</i>

## Who are those involved
Afkanerd is not made for the entire planetary eco-system. It’s an organization for nerds, who in turn make things for the entire planetary eco-system. The problem with limiting this scope comes not from a business point but rather a semantic one; the word nerd. The question might boil down to (minus conventional movie definitions and representations) who is a nerd; this answer would be left for the nerds to answer.

## What’s the vision
Afkanerd hopes to cover the span of the African continent in under a year, and have the leading source of nerd products in same time span. It also has a goal to make public more than 500 startups within this same time frame.
